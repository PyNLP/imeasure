# I-measure

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **I-measure**, a metric used for evaluating grammatical error correction systems. A full description of the method can be found in the following paper, which should be cited whenever you use the script in your work:

# Requirements

These scripts were coded in Python 2.7 and require the `xml.etree.cElementTree` library (usually shipped with Python by default).

# Usage

## Simple usage

You can evaluate a system's output by issuing the following command:

`python ieval.py -hyp:system_output_file -ref:gold_standard_file`

where *system_output_file* is the plain text output generated by an error correction system and *gold_standard_file* is an XML-formatted gold-standard file containing each source sentence with its errors and corrections. You can test the script using the example files provided, e.g.:

`python ieval.py -hyp:example/sys.txt -ref:example/gold.xml`

This will print a table showing the results for the whole input corpus. Apart from the I-measure, the output will include complementary counts and measures that are useful for comparison and error analysis.

## Options

The full set of options accepted by the evaluation script is as follows:

`python ieval.py -ref:<file> -hyp:<file> [-nomix] [-max:<metric>] [-opt:sent|corpus] [-b:<n>] [-w:<n>] [-per-sent] [-v] [-vv]`

where:

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
-ref      | XML file containing gold standard annotations.
-hyp      | Plain text file containing sentence hypotheses (one per line).
-nomix    | Do not mix corrections from different annotators; match the best individual reference instead. By default, the scorer will mix such corrections in order to maximise matches. This option disables default behaviour.
-max      | Maximise scores for the specified metric: *dp*, *dr*, *df*, *dacc*, *dwacc*, *di*, *cp*, *cr*, *cf*, *cacc*, *cwacc* or *ci*. Preceding *d* is for detection, *c* for correction. Available metrics are: *tp* (true positives), *tn* (true negatives), *fp* (false positives), *fn* (false negatives), *p* (precision), *r* (recall), *f* (F measure), *acc* (accuracy), *wacc* (weighted accuracy), *i* (improvement on wacc). Default is **cwacc**.
-opt      | Optimise scores at the sentence or corpus level. Default is **sent**.
-b        | Specify beta for the F measure. Default is **1.0**.
-w        | Specify weight of true and false positives for weighted accuracy. Default is **2.0**.
-per-sent | Show individual results for each sentence.
-v        | Verbose output.
-vv       | Very verbose output.

These parameters can be specified in any order. Those within brackets are optional and will take their default values when omitted.

## Gold standard file format

The gold standard references should be provided in XML format according to the following DTD:

```
<!DOCTYPE GOLD-STANDARD [

<!ELEMENT scripts (script)>
<!ELEMENT script (sentence)>
<!ELEMENT sentence (text,error-list)>
<!ELEMENT text (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT error-list (error)+>
<!ELEMENT error (alt)+>
<!ELEMENT alt (c)+>
<!ELEMENT c (#PCDATA)>

<!ATTLIST script id CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST sentence id CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST sentence numann CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST error id CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST error req NMTOKEN #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST error type NMTOKEN #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST alt ann CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST c end CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST c start CDATA #REQUIRED>

]>
```

The `example` directory contains a sample file (`gold.xml`).
